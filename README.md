# exasol-dbmigration-automation
Taking the exasol db migration scripts and adding my own wrapper to automatically execute the scripts just for some scripting practice.

It should be noted here that I am not an experienced Lua developer and this is simply my attempt to create something new for my own purposes, if this is something that would be useful then please feel free to use it, suggest changes or just change it. Any and all feedback as to how I can improve is welcome if done in a positive and constructive way, otherwise please jog on and go troll someone else.
